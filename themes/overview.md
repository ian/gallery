  Rodeo is built with customization and theme ability in mind. While a default

# Overview

## Theme development

The themes in Rodeo are built with the Handlebars templating language which enables a lot of customization without a lot of overhead. When running a build, everything is compiled into a static site that's blazing fast.

## Handlebars

Our templating language of choice lets you build semantic templates quickly and easily. You can learn more about it here:
